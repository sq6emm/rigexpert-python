I was looking how to access RigExpert AA-55 ZOOM from Python, so I can automate some measurments without buying AA-30.ZERO...

And here it is...

Code is based on:

https://github.com/rigexpert/AntScope2
https://github.com/RigExpertDev/AA-30.ZERO/

Hope it will help you to save some time, having fun.

It is not complete, but its a good start to write your own BasicAntScope2 in Python;)
